              <p>The Belgian Shepherd is a medium-sized athletic breed 
              with a body built for endurance, they typically stand
              between 56 and 66 centimetres with bitches
              being on average 4 centimetres shorter than dogs, 
              they usually weight between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb);<br>
              the breed standard states the ideal height is 62 centimetres 
               for dogs and 58 centimetres for bitches. Breed 
              has a long, slender head with triangular, erect ears that are 
              rounded at the base, and a long, narrow but balanced muzzle,
              according to the breed standard a dog that stands 62 
              centimetres at the withers should have a head that is 25 
              centimetres long and a muzzle approximately half that length.
              The breed's body is muscular but not overly heavy; the body's 
              length from shoulder to haunches is approximately 
              the same as their height at the withers, proportionally
              slightly longer in bitches; they have a 
              straight topline and their belly is neither low-slung
              nor overly high like that of a sighthound. The breed's 
              chest is deep but not overly broad; their neck is muscular, 
              widening at the shoulders with a slight arch at the nape; their
              tail is strong and of medium length and curves upwards slightly at the level of their knee; 
              their forelegs are straight and well-boned, their hind legs are muscular and very powerful, 
              none of the legs are overly heavy.</p>

             <h3 id="temperament">Temperament</h3>
                 <p> Belgian Shepherds are known to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive;
                      they are typically highly trainable, vigilant and hard-working with a strong 
                      guarding instinct making them protective of property and family, and very well
                      suited for service with security services. The Groenendael and Tervueren
                      varieties have a reputation for occasionally being snappy, making them less suitable 
                      as companion dogs for children; the Laekenois, whilst considered very good with 
                      children, can occasionally be troublesome with other dogs. The Belgian
                      Shepherd responds well to training and responds very well to firm and understanding
                      training; they require training from an early age, particularly the Laekenois
                      which can have a tendency to try to dominate a weaker-willed master. The
                      breed is very active, particularly the Malinois which may reflect its 
                      continued breeding for security roles, and they all require exercise; the
                      breed adapts well to living indoors, although the Malinois is least suited 
                      to these environs.

            <p>
                Belgian Shepherds descend from a common type of herding dog as similar Western
                 European breeds like the Bouvier des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd Dog,
                 and for centuries they were used by Belgian shepherds for this task. Unlike in 
                 other European countries where, throughout the 19th century, shepherd breeds were standardised 
                 and breeders made efforts to perpetuate their breeds, by the end of the century the Belgian 
                 Shepherd was becoming obsolete and was at danger of extinction. In 1891, the Club de
                 Chien Berger Belge was formed with the purpose of saving the type and a team led by Professor
                 Adolphe Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary School conducted a field survey of the type.
                 As the Belgian Shepherd had for centuries been bred for working ability with little consideration 
                 given to form, Professor Reul found the type to vary greatly in appearance. As a part of their
                 work, Professor Reul's team assembled 117 specimens and began the process of standardising them
                 into distinct varieties. Classifying them as a single breed, initially Professor Reul's 
                 team divided the breed into six different varieties based on coat type and colour; between
                 1892 when the first breed standard was drafted and 1956, as few as two varieties and as many 
                 as eight were recognised by either the Club de Chien Berger Belge or the Société Royale 
                 Saint-Hubert.

                The Groenendael remains the most popular variety followed by the Tervuren, 
                the Malinois is gaining in popularity while the Laekenois remains comparatively rare. 
                Extremely versatile, Belgian Shepherds are frequently trained for use as assistance dogs, 
                detection dogs, guard dogs, guide dogs, police dogs, search and rescue dogs.
                The breed, in particular the Groenendael, Laekenois and Tervuren varieties, are predominantly 
                kept as pets or companion dogs; all of the varieties are frequently seen competing in obedience 
                competitions and Schutzhund. In recent times, the Laekenois has been employed by the Belgian Army 
                in a variety of roles, the Tervuren is frequently used by government organisations as a drug 
                detection dog. The Malinois in particular has become increasingly popular with customs,
                military, border guard and police forces;] organisations that utilise the Malinois include the United
                States Armed Forces, the United States Secret Service, the Israel Defense Forces Oketz
                Unit, the Australian Defence Force, and the anti-poaching canine unit at the Kruger 
                National Park.
