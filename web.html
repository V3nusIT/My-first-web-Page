            <h3>Appearance</h3>
            <p>The Belgian Shepherd is a medium-sized athletic breed 
                with a body built for endurance, they typically stand <br>
             between 56 and 66 centimetres (22 and 26 in) with bitches
              being on average 4 centimetres (1.6 in) shorter than dogs, 
              they usually weigh between 20 and 30 kilograms (44 and 66 lb);<br>
              the breed standard states the ideal height is 62 centimetres 
              (24 in) for dogs and 58 centimetres (23 in) for bitches. Breed 
              has a long, slender head with triangular, erect ears that are 
              rounded at the base, and a long, narrow but balanced muzzle,
              according to the breed standard a dog that stands 62 
              centimetres at the withers should have a head that is 25 
              centimetres (9.8 in) long and a muzzle approximately half that length.
              The breed's body is muscular but not overly heavy; the body's 
              length from shoulder to haunches is approximately 
              the same as their height at the withers, proportionally
               slightly longer in bitches; they have a 
              straight topline and their belly is neither low-slung
               nor overly high like that of a sighthound.[5] The breed's 
               chest is deep but not overly broad; their neck is muscular, 
               widening at the shoulders with a slight arch at the nape; their
               tail is strong and of medium length and curves upwards slightly at the level of their knee; 
              their forelegs are straight and well-boned, their hind legs are muscular and very powerful, 
              none of the legs are overly heavy.</p>

            <h3>Temperament</h3>
            <p>
                Belgian Shepherds are known to be highly intelligent, alert and sensitive; they are typically highly trainable, vigilant and hard-working with a strong guarding instinct making them protective of property and family, and very well suited for service with security services.[4][5][6] The Groenendael and Tervueren varieties have a reputation for occasionally being snappy, making them less suitable as companion dogs for children; the Laekenois, whilst considered very good with children, can occasionally be troublesome with other dogs.[1][2] The Belgian Shepherd responds well to training and responds very well to firm and understanding training; they require training from an early age, particularly the Laekenois which can have a tendency to try to dominate a weaker-willed master.[1][6] The breed is very active, particularly the Malinois which may reflect its continued breeding for security roles, and they all require exercise; the breed adapts well to living indoors, although the Malinois is least suited to these environs.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>
                Belgian Shepherds descend from a common type of herding dog as similar Western European breeds like the Bouvier des Ardennes, Dutch Shepherd and German Shepherd Dog, and for centuries they were used by Belgian shepherds for this task.[4][8][9] Unlike in other European countries where, throughout the 19th century, shepherd breeds were standardised and breeders made efforts to perpetuate their breeds, by the end of the century the Belgian Shepherd was becoming obsolete and was at danger of extinction.[1][4][8] In 1891, the Club de Chien Berger Belge was formed with the purpose of saving the type and a team led by Professor Adolphe Reul of the Cureghem Veterinary School conducted a field survey of the type.[1][4][9] As the Belgian Shepherd had for centuries been bred for working ability with little consideration given to form, Professor Reul found the type to vary greatly in appearance.[4][6] As a part of their work, Professor Reul's team assembled 117 specimens and began the process of standardising them into distinct varieties.[1][4] Classifying them as a single breed, initially Professor Reul's team divided the breed into six different varieties based on coat type and colour; between 1892 when the first breed standard was drafted and 1956, as few as two varieties and as many as eight were recognised by either the Club de Chien Berger Belge or the Société Royale Saint-Hubert
